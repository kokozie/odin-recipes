    <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <li>Pork belly – For a juicy, meaty dish!</li>
      <li>Garlic – Makes for the most savory stew.</li>
      <li>Dried bay leaves – Gives off the perfect adobo aroma</li>
      <li>
        Vinegar – Part of what makes adobo so brilliantly unique is its
        sourness, which we get from vinegar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Soy sauce – There’s nothing quite like the salty quality of soy sauce!
      </li>
      <li>Peppercorn – Just for the slightest bit of spice!</li>
      <li>Water – As this has a stew, we will definitely be using plenty of water!</li>
    </li> Salt – And to make sure everything is nice and flavorful, you will be using some salt too.</li>
